# Implications 
Although profitable trades were found. There are multiple serious limitations of Performing them primarily on the selling side. The trades of highest profitability create the rarest guns, which consequentially reside in the markets with the fewest buyers. As such, significant discounts would need to be applied to the sale price in order to sell the item quickly to allow for turnaround and repetition of the trade. Additionally, the trades with the highest profits are typically not guaranteed and require high capital requirements. In accordance with the law of large numbers, the trade would be profitable in the long run. However, more real limitations such as capital also need to be considered as the inputs can be quite expensive. Alternatives choices could be made but in this case, return on investment appears closely related to the quantity of capital invested. Lastly, the third-party sites required for sale may or may not be legitimate but typically are trustworthy despite requiring roughly 10% in transaction fees (Depends on the market).
